# Real-Time Object Counting using YOLOv8

## 📌 Project Overview
This project implements a real-time object detection and counting system using the YOLOv8 pre-trained model.  
It supports both **image** and **video** inputs and performs **class-wise object counting** with live visualization.

---

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time object detection
- Class-wise object counting (person, car, truck, etc.)
- Confidence threshold filtering
- Bounding box visualization
- Supports image and video input
- Modular and extensible design

---

## 🧠 Technologies Used
- Python
- OpenCV
- YOLOv8 (Ultralytics)
- Computer Vision

## ▶️ How to Run

### 1️⃣ Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt

2️⃣ Run on Image
python image_count.py

3️⃣ Run on Video
python video_count.py

📊 Sample Output

The system displays bounding boxes and real-time object counts on the screen .
